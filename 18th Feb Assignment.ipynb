    "\n",
    "Scalability: APIs can help to improve the scalability of applications, as they allow developers\n",

    "\n",
    "Flexibility: APIs can be used to build applications that can run on a variety of platforms and devices. \n",

    "Security: APIs can introduce security risks if they are not designed or implemented properly.\n",

    "REST is a lightweight and flexible architecture for building web services and APIs that\n",
